      <p> "If your dreams dont scare you, they aren't big enough" this is one of the quotes I refer back to every
        single day.<br>
        This quote reminds me that I am capable of acomplishing anything I put my mind too (with hard work of course!).<br>
        I want people of all ages to start setting bigger, crazier goals for themselves (reach for the stars!).
        <br>"if it's not impossible, its possible!"<br>

         <br>I am a strong advocate for living a more positive, pro-active lifestyle.
        When i'm not working, learning, or getting coffee; you would most likely find me excersising, styling,
        reading, or brainstorming (but I usually spend any free time I have with family & friends!).<br>
        Now that you know alittle bit more about myself, you're probably wondering what my ambitions are...?<br></p>

      <p>   My ambitions are constantly growing however, ultimately I want to become a role model
        for the younger generations I want the young people to know you can start making a difference in this world at any age.<br>
        I want to motivate the young to take initiative, try harder, care more, and be kinder. There must be some confusion with <br>
        everything ive said so far, where does programming come in?<br>
        Its a funny story (i'll keep it short), one day I was looking up "what goes into building an app" coding popped up and so did<br>
        this UO bootcamp program. The rest is history. I knew this was the next tool i wanted to acquire for my toolbelt, As well as<br>
         a perfect begining to a much bigger plan im hoping to work hard in this program channel my inner programming sensei out and<br>
         become successfully employeed in this field to show that anything is possibe and anyone can do it! i want to become a successful <br>
         entruprenuer and leave a legacy, maybe even write a book someday!<br>
